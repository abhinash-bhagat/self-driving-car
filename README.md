# Self-Driving Car using Udacity Car Simulator

## Overview
This project implements a self-driving car simulation using the Udacity Car Simulator. It leverages various machine learning and computer vision techniques to navigate and drive autonomously within the simulator environment.

## Features
- Real-time car control in the Udacity simulator
- Data collection and preprocessing tools
- Training scripts and evaluation metrics
- Autonomous Driving in the simulator
